    <h1>What I do when I'm not slaying talent demons?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>Training</em> - now onto daily doses of 6km eliptic trainer and 16
        minutes of plank, both on a Tabata interval (2-1 minute and 20-10
        seconds respectively.) I've seen it's positive effects even if I have to
        skip days at times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Guitar</em> - been on and off for time memorial. Not doing it daily
        so probably doesn't count. Still, it's here for the record.
      </li>
      <li>
          <em>Yoga</em> - along with ayurveda. it is a thing I do daily.
      </li>
      <li>
          <em>Qi gong</em> - again I do it every morning. Usually a set sequence of forms.
      </li>
      <li>
          <em>Astrology & numerology</em> - I chalk it up to being raised in a dull communist Hungary.
      </li>
    </ul>
